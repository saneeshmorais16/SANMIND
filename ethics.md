# Ethics & Safety (Draft)

- SanMind is a **student research project**, not a medical device and not a replacement for therapy or emergency services.
- **Informed consent**: Users must be told what data is collected and how it is used.
- **Data minimisation**: Collect only what is necessary; allow users to opt out of audio.
- **Crisis protocol**: If crisis language is detected, do not provide therapeutic advice. Instead, show helplines and advise contacting emergency services.
- **Bias & limitations**: Emotion models may underperform for slang, sarcasm, diverse accents, and cultural contexts. Evaluate and disclose.
